# Loop through all the data and print each row.

# question 5 - Loop through all the data and print out the total for each invoice (Note: this data is not provided by the csv, you will need to calculate it. Also, keep in mind the data from the csv comes back as a string, you will need to convert it to a float. Research how to do this.).

# question 7 - Close your open file.

open_file.close()



# Challenge: Do some research and see if you can limit your floats to never exceed to characters after the decimal point.





# Going Further - Explore the graphing tools covered in todayâ€™s lecture. See if you can implement one of them to display the total income of chocolate cupcakes vs vanilla cupcakes vs strawberry cupcakes.
